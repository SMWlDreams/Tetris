# Change Log

## v0.1.0 Alpha

Initial testing release

Move your tetris pieces using A and D. Rotate them with the "." and "/" keys. Soft drop using S.

### NOTE

This is an alpha release. There are no animations and no audio currently. The game will run a single instance; upon losing you will need to restart it in order to play again. All core features of the hit NES game TETRIS are here.

All graphics were manually redrawn by me. The color palate was inspired by the original TETRIS game for the NES.
