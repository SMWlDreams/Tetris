# Change Log

## v0.1.0 Alpha

Initial testing release

Move your tetris pieces using A and D. Rotate them with the "." and "/" keys. Soft drop using S.

## v0.2.0 Alpha

### Improvements

### Bug Fixes

Score will no longer drop a digit after placing the first shape

If you attempt to rotate a shape with a tile above the edge of the board it will no longer randomly become visible

### NOTE

This is an alpha release. There are no animations and no audio currently. The game will run a single instance; upon losing you will need to restart it in order to play again. All core features of the hit NES game TETRIS are here.

All graphics were manually redrawn by me. The color palate was inspired by the original TETRIS game for the NES.
